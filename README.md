Community Issue Reporting App
Project Description
This is a Windows Forms application developed in C# that allows users to easily report community issues. The application provides a user-friendly interface to submit details about an issue, including its location, category, and a detailed description. Users can also attach media files (images or documents) to their reports. All submitted issues are stored in a data structure within the application for later review.

Features
Issue Submission: A dedicated form to report issues with required fields.

Categorization: Users can select an issue category from a predefined list (Sanitation, Roads, Utilities).

Media Attachment: Allows users to attach supporting files (images, documents) to their report.

Progress Indicator: A progress bar provides visual feedback during the submission process.

Data Storage: Reported issues are stored in a List within the application, creating a log of all submissions.

User Feedback: Provides a summary message confirming a successful report.

How to Use
Open the Application: Launch the main form of the application.

Click "Report Issues": Navigate to the Report Issues Form by clicking the corresponding button.

Fill Out the Form:

Enter the Location of the issue in the provided text box.

Select a Category from the dropdown menu.

Write a detailed Description of the issue.

Attach Media (Optional): Click the "Attach Media" button to select a file from your computer.

Submit Report: Click the "Submit" button to finalize and store your report. A confirmation message will appear upon successful submission.

Local Announcements and Events Page
When you pick "Local Events and Announcements," a Windows Form that visually displays future local events and announcements is presented.  With the use of the form's search feature, users may quickly locate events by dates and categories.  To maximise event organisation and retrieval, sophisticated data structures like sorted dictionaries are employed.

Technical specifications for announcements and local events  When necessary, page stacks, queues, or priority queues are used to efficiently manage event-related data structures.  Event data is organised and retrieved using hash tables, dictionaries, or sorted dictionaries.  Sets are used to effectively manage special categories or dates.

A recommendation Feature
Based on user searches, a recommendation system is put into place.  In order to propose relevant or suggested events, the program examines user search trends and interests.  These suggestions are created using the proper algorithms or data structures.

Technologies
Language: C#

Framework: .NET Framework

UI: Windows Forms

Code Structure
This project uses the standard Windows Forms partial class structure, which separates the user interface code from the application logic.

ReportIssuesForm.cs: Contains the custom logic for button click events and data handling.

ReportIssuesForm.Designer.cs: Automatically generated by Visual Studio's designer, containing the code for form layout and component initialization. This file should not be manually edited.

ReportedIssue.cs: A custom class used to model and store the data for each reported issue.

The logic for displaying announcements and events, managing search and filter operations, and communicating with event data structures and the recommendation engine is all contained in EventsForm.cs.

The layout and component initialisation for the Local Events and Announcements form are contained in EventsForm.Designer.cs, which is automatically generated by Visual Studio's designer.  

To store and manage event data, Event.cs defines the event data model and implements data structures like SortedDictionary, Dictionary, Queue, PriorityQueue, and Set.
Service Request Status Tracker
It uses a Binary Search Tree (BST), a Max-Heap, and a Directed Graph to handle different aspects of data management efficiently.
Feature 1: Fast Request Searching
This feature allows users to look up the status and details of any service request quickly using its unique Request ID.
Implementation: Binary Search Tree (BST)
•	Structure: The BST organizes all ServiceRequestData objects. The structure is based on the Request ID, ensuring the tree remains ordered. Nodes with smaller IDs are placed in the left subtree, and nodes with larger IDs are placed in the right subtree.
•	Mechanism: When a user enters an ID to track, the system performs a search starting at the root of the tree. By comparing the target ID to the current node's ID, the search can eliminate half of the remaining data set in each step.
•	Efficiency: This approach minimises the number of comparisons needed, providing an average search time complexity which is highly efficient for quick lookups in large datasets.

Feature 2: Priority Management
This feature ensures that the most urgent tasks are always visible and prioritized for immediate action.
Implementation: Max-Heap
•	Structure: The Max-Heap stores the requests, but it orders them based on the Severity property. This means the highest severity item is always positioned at the root.
•	Mechanism: When a new request is added, it is placed at the end and then via the Heap Up process. It swaps places with its parent if its severity is higher until the Max-Heap property is satisfied.
•	Functionality: The application uses this structure to efficiently retrieve and display the top the most critical requests. Because the most critical item is always at the top, retrieval time is very fast.

Feature 3: Workflow Validation
This feature controls how a request can move from one status to the next, preventing invalid  jumps in the workflow process.
Implementation: Directed Graph
•	Structure: The request statuses (e.g., "Submitted," "In Progress," "Completed") are represented as nodes in the graph. The valid movements between these statuses are modelled as one-way directed edges (e.g., an edge exists from "In Progress" to "Awaiting Parts," but not vice-versa in most cases).
•	Mechanism: The workflow is stored internally as an Adjacency List, where each status node points to a list of other statuses it can legally transition to. When a request is tracked, the system looks up its status in the list.
•	Functionality: This list shows the user the Next Valid Statuses for the current request, enforcing the business rules. This ensures, for example, that a request cannot go directly from "Submitted" to "Completed" if the defined workflow graph does not include that specific transition edge.
