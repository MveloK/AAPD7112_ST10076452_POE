Community Issue Reporting App
Project Description
This is a Windows Forms application developed in C# that allows users to easily report community issues. The application provides a user-friendly interface to submit details about an issue, including its location, category, and a detailed description. Users can also attach media files (images or documents) to their reports. All submitted issues are stored in a data structure within the application for later review.

Features

Categorization: Users can select an issue category from a predefined list (Sanitation, Roads, Utilities).

Media Attachment: Allows users to attach supporting files (images, documents) to their report.

Progress Indicator: A progress bar provides visual feedback during the submission process.

Data Storage: Reported issues are stored in a List within the application, creating a log of all submissions.

User Feedback: Provides a summary message confirming a successful report.

Local Announcements and Events Page
When you pick "Local Events and Announcements," a Windows Form that visually displays future local events and announcements is presented.  With the use of the form's search feature, users may quickly locate events by dates and categories.  To maximise event organisation and retrieval, sophisticated data structures like sorted dictionaries are employed.

Technical specifications for announcements and local events  When necessary, page stacks, queues, or priority queues are used to efficiently manage event-related data structures.  Event data is organised and retrieved using hash tables, dictionaries, or sorted dictionaries.  Sets are used to effectively manage special categories or dates.

A recommendation Feature
Based on user searches, a recommendation system is put into place.  In order to propose relevant or suggested events, the program examines user search trends and interests.  These suggestions are created using the proper algorithms or data structures.

Technologies
Language: C#

Framework: .NET Framework

UI: Windows Forms

Code Structure
This project uses the standard Windows Forms partial class structure, which separates the user interface code from the application logic.

ReportIssuesForm.cs: Contains the custom logic for button click events and data handling.

ReportIssuesForm.Designer.cs: Automatically generated by Visual Studio's designer, containing the code for form layout and component initialization. This file should not be manually edited.

ReportedIssue.cs: A custom class used to model and store the data for each reported issue.

The logic for displaying announcements and events, managing search and filter operations, and communicating with event data structures and the recommendation engine is all contained in EventsForm.cs.

The layout and component initialisation for the Local Events and Announcements form are contained in EventsForm.Designer.cs, which is automatically generated by Visual Studio's designer.  

In order to store and manage event data, Event.cs defines the event data model and implements data structures like SortedDictionary, Dictionary, Queue, PriorityQueue, and Set.
